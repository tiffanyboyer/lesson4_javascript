### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Client-side programming is necessary in order to develope interactive/reactive pages. These programs are written in JavaScript, JScript and VBScript and are embedded into the HTML of a Web page. The HTML tags identify components. This communicates with the browser and allows the output of the program with the static content of the HTML.)
2. (Script vs. Programs: a scripting language is a simple, interpreted programming language. The scripts are plain text that get interpreted by the application. This makes for simpler application, saves bandwidth, and ensures platform independence.)
3. (Java & JavaScript are NOT the same. JavaScript is interpreted in the browser, while Java programs are compiled and can be run as stand alone applications.)
